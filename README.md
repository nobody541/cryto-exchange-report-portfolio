# React Management Report

This is a minimal React version of the `report/general` page.

## Run

1. Install dependencies.
2. Start the dev server.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Notes

- Charts are placeholders to match the original layout where Plotly outputs were injected by Django.
- Account modal images were copied from the Django static assets.
